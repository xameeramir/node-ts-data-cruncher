Given the following JSON data

[{"Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 171, "WeightKg": 96 }, {"Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 161,
"WeightKg":85 }, { "Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 180, "WeightKg": 77 }, { "Gender": "Female",
"HeightCm": 166,"WeightKg": 62}, {"Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 150, "WeightKg": 70},
{"Gender": "Female","HeightCm": 167, "WeightKg": 82} 
as the input with weight and height
parameters of a person, we have to perform the following:

Calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) using Formula 1, BMI Category and Health risk from
Table 1 of the person and add them as 3 new columns

2) Count the total number of overweight people using ranges in the column BMI Category of
Table 1, check this is consistent programmatically and add any Other observations in the
documentation

3) Create build, teststo make sure the code is working as expected and this can be added to an
automation build / test / deployment pipeline
Formula 1 - BMI
2 2 BMI(kg/m ) = mass(kg) / height(m)
The BMI (Body MassIndex) in (kg/m) is equalto the weightin kilograms(kg) divided by your heightin
meterssquared (m)2 For example, if you are 175cm (1.75m) in height and 75kg in weight, you can
calculate your BMI as follows: 75kg / (1.75m2) = 24.49kg/m2.

Table 1 - BMI Category and the Health Risk.
BMI Category
Underweight Normal weight Overweight Moderately obese Severel obese Very severely obese
Challenge
BMI Range (kg/m2)
18.4 and below 18.5

35- 39.9
40 and above
